## Definition of “Data Visualization”

Visualizations are everywhere. Data and information is becoming more accessible all the time. To absorb and utilize the value from all this data, we must incorporate the concept of "data visualization" (data vis). **Simply, data visualization refers to data represented by a visual image**. Some of the most common and basic data vis applications include bar graphs, line graphs, and scatterplots. The general design concepts in this publicaion apply to any type of data visualization in any mode (Excel, Powerpoint, R, other programming languages).

## Background

Many authors have produced books, papers, and websites and blogs which discuss and explain data vis topics. We intend to summarize general design concepts in this publication, to maximize your viewers' absorption of the intended message(s).

## Why Do We Need Data Visualizations?

With the explosion of data availability and tools to analyze it, we also need the skills to **communicate the message most effectively**. Visualization programs and coding languages enable the production of graphs and graphics, but without some fine tuning the default graph styles may not enable the viewer to clearly and quickly absorb the message. 

## Why Do All Actuaries Need to Learn Data Visualization Basics

Actuaries excel at analyzing data and drawing conclusions from their work, but the **visual communication skills** through graphs, charts, tables, etc. are not on the exam syllabus, nor are they regularly taught or reinforced extensively. However, most actuaries must _regularly_ communicate complex patterns, trends, conclusions, ideas, and concepts with each other or non-actuarial business partners.

I've always said to myself and others, "We can do the best work with the best data resulting in the best conclusion, but if we can't communicate it effectively, the message is LOST".

With a little knowledge, practice, and effort, we can create visualizations so that our viewers absorb the clear message that we intend to send. We provide practical tips to make your data visualizations sing!
